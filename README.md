# Customer Purchase Data Segmentation

### 📌 Project Overview
This project uses unsupervised learning to analyze synthetic customer purchase behavior. By generating data clusters based on annual income and spending scores, we can simulate customer segmentation for marketing insights.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn (make_blobs), Pandas, Matplotlib
* **Platform:** Google Colab

### 📊 Key Analysis Steps
* **Data Generation:** Created a synthetic dataset with clear clusters using `make_blobs`.
* **Exploration:** Converted raw data into a DataFrame for structured analysis.
* **Visualization:** Plotted raw data to understand existing structures before clustering.
